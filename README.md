# SpryCss
A minimal CSS Toolkit

The objective of SpryCss is to be a quick and simple CSS Toolkit with some common components while being as 
lightweight as possible (Only 12kb when gzipped). It can be time consuming and tedious to constantly come up with class names for elements that just need simple layout styles like padding, margin, alignment, etc. 
SpryCss is set to provide enough utility classes so you don't have to worry about that anymore, 
but not set out to try and do everything which can bloat your project. If an element needs more then 
just the basic utility styles then it is most likely an element that should have a custom class name 
and custom styles in your CSS files.
